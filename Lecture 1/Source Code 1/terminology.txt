Theorem Proving
* initial state: starting knowledge base
* actions: inference rules
* transition model: new knowledge base after inference
* goal test: check statement we are trying to prove
* path cost function: number of steps in proof



Resolution
* another way of applying inference

CNF

* eliminate biconditionals
* eliminate implications
* use DeMorgan's law
* distribution
